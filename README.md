🧠 Customer Behavior Score Classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify customer behavior scores based on historical and behavioral data — including payment delay history, debt-to-income ratio, spending patterns, and other financial indicators.
The goal is to analyze customer habits and predict their risk/behavior rating using supervised learning techniques.
